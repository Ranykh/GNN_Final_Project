# Graph Neural Network (GNN) Final Project

This repository contains the final project for the **Topics in Geometric Deep Learning** course. The project focuses on **graph classification** using various GNN architectures, with detailed experimentation and analysis.

## üìú Project Overview

### Objective
The objective of this project was to build a **graph classification model** that can effectively classify graphs into binary classes. We explored different architectures and introduced Gaussian-enhanced models to handle uncertainty in node embeddings.

### Key Architectures
We implemented and evaluated the following GNN architectures:
- **Graph Attention Network (GAT)**
- **GraphSAGE**
- **Gaussian-enhanced GAT**
- **Gaussian-enhanced GraphSAGE**

The Gaussian-enhanced models introduced uncertainty by learning Gaussian embeddings, represented by means and variances, using reparameterization and KL divergence regularization.

### Key Results
The **GraphSAGE** model with dropout proved to be the most stable and accurate, achieving:
- **Training Accuracy**: ~0.95-1.0
- **Validation Accuracy**: Stable and high performance with fine-tuned hyperparameters.

For details, see the [report.pdf](report.pdf).

- The training accuracy gradually improves to ~0.95.
- Validation accuracy stabilizes around ~0.9, showcasing the model's generalization ability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation
